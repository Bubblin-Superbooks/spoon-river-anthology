<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Deacon Taylor</h4><p class="  start-chapter">I BELONGED to the church,
And to the party of prohibition;
And the villagers thought I died of eating watermelon.
In truth I had cirrhosis of the liver,
For every noon for thirty years,
I slipped behind the prescription partition
In Trainor's drug store
And poured a generous drink
From the bottle marked "Spiritus frumenti."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
