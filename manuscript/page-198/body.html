<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">as I entered,
Flattered by Solomon's invitation,
To be the County—board's secretary.
And out in the cold stood all my followers:
Young idealists, broken warriors
Hobbling on one crutch of hope—
Souls that staked their all on the truth,
Losers of worlds at heaven's bidding,
Watching the Devil kick the Millennium
Over the Golden Mountain.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
