<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Hamlet Micure</h4><p class=" stretch-last-line start-chapter">IN a lingering fever many visions come to you:
I was in the little house again
With its great yard of clover
Running down to the board-fence,
Shadowed by the oak tree,
Where we children had our swing.
Yet the little house was a manor hall
Set in a lawn, and by the lawn was the sea.
I was in the room where little Paul
Strangled from diphtheria,
But yet it was not this room—
It was a sunny verandah enclosed
With mullioned windows
And in a chair sat a man in a dark cloak
With a face like Euripides.
He had come to visit me, or I had gone to visit him—I could not tell.
We could hear the beat of the sea, the clover nodded
Under a summer</p></div> </div>
