Trusted by them and by you, Spoon River, equally
In spite of the whispers that I was a lobbyist.
Moving quietly through the world, rich and courted.

And in death have neither stones nor epitaphs,
How do you like your silence from mouths stopped
With the dust of my triumphant career?</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
