Oh! well, you know how the children cried,
And how my wife pitied and hated me,
And how I came to lie here.</p><p>W. Lloyd Garrison Standard</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">VEGETARIAN, non—resistant, free-thinker, in ethics a Christian;
Orator apt at the rhine-stone rhythm of Ingersoll.
Carnivorous, avenger, believer and pagan.
Continent, promiscuous, changeable, treacherous, vain,
Proud, with the pride that makes struggle a thing for laughter;
With heart cored out by the worm of theatric despair.
Wearing the coat of indifference to hide the shame of defeat;
I, child of the abolitionist idealism—
A sort of Brand in a birth of half-and-half.
What other thing could happen when I defended
The patriot scamps who burned the court house
That Spoon River might have a new one
Than plead them guilty?
When Kinsey Keene drove through
The card—board mask of my life with a spear of light,
What could I do but slink</p></div> </div>
