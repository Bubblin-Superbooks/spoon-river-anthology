<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Daisy Fraser</h4><p class=" stretch-last-line start-chapter">Did you ever hear of Editor Whedon
Giving to the public treasury any of the money he received
For supporting candidates for office?
Or for writing up the canning factory
To get people to invest?
Or for suppressing the facts about the bank,
When it was rotten and ready to break?
Did you ever hear of the Circuit Judge
Helping anyone except the "Q" railroad,
Or the bankers? Or did Rev. Peet or Rev. Sibley
Give any part of their salary, earned by keeping still,
Or speaking out as the leaders wished them to do,
To the building of the water works?
But IDaisy Fraser who always passed
Along the street through rows of nods</p></div> </div>
