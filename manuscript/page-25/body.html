Your love was not all in vain.
I owe whatever I was in life
To your hope that would not give me up,
To your love that saw me still as good.

The milliner's daughter made me trouble
And out I went in the world,
Where I passed through every peril known
Of wine and women and joy of life.

I was drinking wine with a black-eyed cocotte,
And the tears swam into my eyes.

For thought of her conquest over me.
