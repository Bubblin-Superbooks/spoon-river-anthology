As for myself I overcame my lower nature
Only to be destroyed by my brother's ambition.</p><p>Rev. Abner Peet</p><p>I HAD no objection at all
To selling my household effects at auction
On the village square.
It gave my beloved flock the chance
To get something which had belonged to me
For a memorial.
But that trunk which was struck off
To Burchard, the grog-keeper!
Did you know it contained the manuscripts
Of a lifetime of sermons?
And he burned them as waste paper.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
