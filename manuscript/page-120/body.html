<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">under my cedar tree.
Harry killed himself after a debauch, Susan was divorced—
I sat under my cedar tree. Paul was invalided from over study,
Mary became a recluse at home for love of a man—
I sat under my cedar tree.
All were gone, or broken-winged or devoured by life—
I sat under my cedar tree.
My mate, the mother of them, was taken—
I sat under my cedar tree,
Till ninety years were tolled.
O maternal Earth, which rocks the fallen leaf to sleep.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
