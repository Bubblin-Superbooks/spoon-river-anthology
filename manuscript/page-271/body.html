<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Lincoln, actor indeed, playing well your part
And Booth, who strode in a mimic play within the play,
Often and often I saw you,
As the cawing crows winged their way to the wood
Over my houseâ€”top at solemn sunsets,
There by my window,
Alone.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
