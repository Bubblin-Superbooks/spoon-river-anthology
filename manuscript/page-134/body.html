<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Hamilton Greene</h4><p class="  start-chapter">I WAS the only child of Frances Harris of Virginia
And Thomas Greene of Kentucky,
Of valiant and honorable blood both.
To them I owe all that I became,
Judge, member of Congress, leader in the State.
From my mother I inherited
Vivacity, fancy, language;
From my father will, judgment, logic.
All honor to them
For what service I was to the people!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
