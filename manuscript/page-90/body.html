<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>William And Emily</h4><p class="  start-chapter">THERE is something about
Death Like love itself!
If with some one with whom you have known passion
And the glow of youthful love,
You also, after years of life
Together, feel the sinking of the fire
And thus fade away together,
Gradually, faintly, delicately,
As it were in each other's arms,
Passing from the familiar roomâ€”
That is a power of unison between souls
Like love itself!</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
