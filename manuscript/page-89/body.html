<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">ask you:
If all of the children, born here in Spoon River
Had been reared by the
County, somewhere on a farm;
And the fathers and mothers had been given their freedom
To live and enjoy, change mates if they wished,
Do you think that Spoon River
Had been any the worse?</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
