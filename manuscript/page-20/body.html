<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Amanda Barker</h4><p class="  start-chapter">HENRY got me with child,
Knowing that I could not bring forth life
Without losing my own.
In my youth therefore I entered the portals of dust.
Traveler, it is believed in the village where I lived
That Henry loved me with a husband's love
But I proclaim from the dust
That he slew me to gratify his hatred.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
