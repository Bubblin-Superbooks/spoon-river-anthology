<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">afar,
The antennae of
Thought that listens through utmost space.
Surely the concord that ruled my spirit is proof
Of an Ear that tuned me, able to tune me over
And use me again if I am worthy to use.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
