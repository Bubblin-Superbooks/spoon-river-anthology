<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><h4>Caroline Branson</h4><p class=" stretch-last-line start-chapter">WITH our hearts like drifting suns, had we but walked,
As often before, the April fields till star—light
Silkened over with viewless gauze the darkness
Under the cliff, our trysting place in the wood,
Where the brook turns! Had we but passed from wooing
Like notes of music that run together, into winning,
In the inspired improvisation of love!
But to put back of us as a canticle ended
The rapt enchantment of the flesh,
In which our souls swooned, down, down,
Where time was not, nor space, nor ourselves—
Annihilated in love!
To leave these behind for a room with lamps:
And to stand with our Secret</p></div> </div>
