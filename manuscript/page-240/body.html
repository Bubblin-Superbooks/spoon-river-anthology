<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">eyeless Nature that makes you drink
From the cup of Love, though you know it's poisoned;
To whom would your flower-face have been lifted?
Botanist, weakling?
Cry of what blood to yours?—
Pure or foul, for it makes no matter,
It's blood that calls to our blood.
And then your children—oh, what might they be?
And what your sorrow?
Child! Child Death is better than Life.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
