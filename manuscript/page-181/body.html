Who spent your talents rallying noble reasons
Around the saloon, as if Liberty

Who almost stoned me for a tyrant
Garbed as a moralist,
And as a wry-faced ascetic frowning upon Yorkshire pudding,
Roast beef and ale and good will and rosy cheerâ€”
Things you never saw in a grog-shop in your life?

And your goddess, Liberty, unmasked as a strumpet,
Selling out the streets of Spoon River
To the insolent giants
