<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">pea-cock screams of demirepsâ€”
And you look up, and there's your Theft,
Who waited until your head was gray,
And your heart skipped beats to say to you:
The game is ended. I've called for you,
Go out on Broadway and be run over,
They'll ship you back to Spoon River.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
