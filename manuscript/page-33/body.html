Hooted at, jeered at by the Yahoos of the street
For my heavy body, cock-eye, and rolling walk,
And all the more when "Butch" Weldy
Captured me after a brutal hunt.
He left me to my fate with Doctor Meyers;
And I sank into death, growing numb from the feet up,
Like one stepping deeper and deeper into a stream of ice.
Will some one go to the village newspaper,
And gather into a book the verses I wrote?â€”
I thirsted so for love
I hungered so for life!</p><p>"Indignation" Jones</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">You would not believe, would you
That I came from</p></div> </div>
