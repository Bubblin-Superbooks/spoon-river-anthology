At last when I came to lie in bed
Weak and in pain, with the dreams about me,
The soul of the river had entered my soul,
And the gathered power of my soul was moving
So swiftly it seemed to be at rest
Under cities of cloud and under
Spheres of silver and changing worldsâ€”
Until I saw a flash of trumpets
Above the battlements over Time.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
