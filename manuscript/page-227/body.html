Around and around and into a heap.
And then they arrested me as a witness,
And I lost my train and staid in Spoon River
To wage my battle of life to the end.

Loitering listless about the streets,
And tying rags round your festering soul,
Who failed to fight it out.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
